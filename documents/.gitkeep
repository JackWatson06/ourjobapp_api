Documents are any user uploaded documents into the system. We will want to look to keep these more secure as time goes on
we need to encrypt the rested documents so that if someone got into our server they cant decrypt... although if our key is
on the server that is just security through obfuscation of the key. Maybe we just use a third party for that. No need to re-invent
the wheel.
