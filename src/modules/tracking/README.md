# Tracking Module
In this tiny module, we track if the user logged in through an affiliate link. When the user
hits an affiliate route on the front end we check to see if they are an affiliate in the system.
After confirmation, we send back a cookie to track the signup using an affiliate link. Once
the user creates a new account we will link the new account to the user through the affiliate link.
